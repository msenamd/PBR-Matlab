# Particle Burn Rate Model - Matlab 
 The MATLAB version of the UMD particle burn rate model

- 0D/1D rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical particles with rectilinear, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems, respectively
- 1D particles are treated as porous solids
- Solves mass conservation for solid species, energy conservation, gas-phase conservation, and pressure evolution
- Thermal degradation model includes drying, thermal pyrolysis, oxidative pyrolysis, and char oxidation
